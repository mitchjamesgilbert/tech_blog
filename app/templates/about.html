    <h1 class="text-center terminal-green-title">About Me</h1>
    <p class="text-muted text-center">
        Hi, I’m Laura, a Computer Science student with a keen interest in technology, systems, and solving practical problems.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted text-center">
        Over the past few years, I’ve built a foundation in IT, networking, and security through completing the 
        <strong>CompTIA A+</strong>, <strong>Network+</strong>, and <strong>CCNA</strong>. Alongside my degree, I’ve been exploring how to apply what I’ve learnt by working on personal projects.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted text-center">
        This website is one of those projects. Built with <strong>Flask</strong>, it’s a space for me to document my progress, experiment with new tools and technologies, and improve my coding skills. Recently, I’ve been particularly focused on <strong>Linux administration</strong>, <strong>virtualisation</strong>, and setting up a home lab using <strong>Proxmox</strong> for self-hosted solutions.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted text-center">
        My main areas of interest include <strong>networking</strong>, <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, <strong>DevOps</strong>, and <strong>cloud computing</strong>. I enjoy exploring how these fields intersect and finding practical ways to apply them.
    </p>
