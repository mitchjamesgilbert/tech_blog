I have gradually been updating and bettering my home network to get some hands-on practice. It is an iterative process with a lot of hiccups along the way. I have been using second-hand devices in all cases as it is cheaper and I don't particularly like buying brand new electronics due to the e-waste.

I have a new thin client arriving tomorrow which will be my router. I plan to use a Fujitsu Futro S930 with PfSense installed as the OS. This will connect to an Access Point which will allow me to get rid of my old ISP-provided SOHO router.

Here is a high level map of my planned network:

Once the new router is up and running and has proven reliable, I will start to configure VLANs in the network.
